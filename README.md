### Welcome to my little info site. :blush:

##
I am Mat, a full stack developer since the beginning of my career. I have the most experience working with React and Spring Boot, but recently i fall in love with React + NodeJs combination. Apart from my normal job, i do some side projects creating applications for small clients, so app from start to bottom are nothing new to me :smile: I always try to keep up with new technology and i am never afraid to learn something new
