## Hello

I am Mat, a senior full-stack developer. Fan of Svelte, Go and Rust. And a little obsessed with bears.

I've been coding since 2012 and have never stopped loving it. For me, each new programming task is like a small puzzle to solve - the more challenging, the better. And when I find an elegant and efficient solution ... that is truly satisfying.

I am also the creator / CEO of the [UpSend](https://www.upsend.app), the easiest way to manage files, images, and emails in your application. Feel free to try it out, as it's free!

Trying to spread the love for lesser-known technologies via Articles and Twitter. You can help out by following me :)
