### Welcome to my little info site. :blush:

###
I am Mat, a full stack developer since the beginning of my career. Apart from my normal job, i do some side projects creating applications for small clients, so apps from start to bottom are nothing new to me :smile: I always try to keep up with new technology and i am never afraid to learn something new.
<!--
I have the most experience working with React and Spring Boot, but recently i fall in love with React + NodeJs combination.
