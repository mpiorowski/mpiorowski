## Hello

I am Mat, a principal software developer. Fan of Svelte, Go (+ HTMX) and Rust. And a little obsessed with bears.

I've been coding since 2012 and have never stopped loving it. For me, each new programming task is like a small puzzle to solve - the more challenging, the better. And when I find an elegant and efficient solution ... that is truly satisfying.

Currently have a pleasure of working at Solace as Head of Development.
