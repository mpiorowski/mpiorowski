### Welcome to page.

###
I am Mat, a full stack developer since the beginning of my career, focusing mainly on JS / React. Apart from my normal job, i do some side projects creating applications for small clients, or something for my personal use :) , so apps created from start to end are nothing new to me :blush: I always try to keep up with new technology and i am never afraid to learn something new.
<!--
I have the most experience working with React and Spring Boot, but recently i fall in love with React + NodeJs combination.
